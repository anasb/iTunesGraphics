Stylish and cool Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) is in Los Angeles as well for the holiday season, but he's not there to give out presents. He's there to take: more than $600 million in negotiable bearer bonds from the multinational Nakatomi Corporation, where McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is an executive. When the takeover becomes hostile, it's up to John McClane to take on the terrorists with all the grit and determination he can muster--but not without a sense of humor.",

He's got a nose for danger, a penchant for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and a talent for overcoming incredible odds. But this time, danger is looking for him. Seeking a very personal and mysterious revenge against McClane, a malevolent genius named Simon (Jeremy Irons) is forcing the heroic cop to play a deadly game. The stakes: New York City itself. The game begins when a phone call from Simon sends McClane to Harlem, where he unexpectedly forms an alliance with the very unwilling Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson). McClane and Zeus soon find themselves careening across the Big Apple, pursuing the deadly Simon, who's always one step ahead of them.",
